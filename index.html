				<h2>Rats In Society</h2>
				<img  src="https://media.wired.com/photos/6520b103a29b839c0f7c05a2/master/pass/In-Defense-Of-Rats-Science-531900677.jpg" alt="A pile of young rats in a cuddle puddle." class="main-image">
				<h3>With Six Humans for Every One Rat on Earth, are We Not the Pest?</h3>
				<p>Rats have been a part of human society for over four thousand years, depite this long standing relationship, rats are often viewed as scum and unwanted. While this is reasonable if you are in a part of the world where rats offer disease, most people who will proudly announce their distain for the creature will have never met one. So what has rat society done that was so awful to make humans hate them so much?</p>
				<p>Almost seven centuries ago the black rat, or the rattus rattus, spread the black plague through flees. The humans in europe, who were known to not bathe, often walked in streets filled with excrement, and who believed "Medicinal Canibalism" made sense, were simply unequipt to deal with a plague. This desease killed around 65% of the population. Because of this moment in history, people have learned to fear the common rat. They must be so discusting to spread so much illness! However, the people only made the problem worse. Reguardless, if you want to blame the rat, you must blame rattus rattus.</p>
				<p>The most common rat in North America is known as the brown rat, or Rattus norvegicus. This rat is actually the reason that 65% didn't become 100%. The Rattus norvegicus was territorial and pushed the rattus rattus out of Europe, saving those who were left. However that is not taught in schools. Because of this hate towards rats, people are cruel to them, treat them like they are not worthy of life, or compassion.</p>
				<p>Our hate as a society for this creature is so ingrained in our society that the name rat is a word for a person that snitches. Rats are compassionate, and kind. They are cleaner then we give them credit for, and they love each other and their families. A better representation of what rats are really like is Rattatui, staring Remi the rat, who just wants to be a chef. That is why I am awarding Remi with the award of Best Fictional Rat.</p>
				<p>Remi showed countless people that rats aren't just little creatures who steal food in the night, they're also dreamers with passion and strong family ties. Remi showed us, food regulation laws are discriminatory against rats, and grabbing a stray animal off the streets could lead to a successful business venture. So, in the name of Remi, go out there, grab a creature of the night, ask them if they want to be a Chef, or Accountant, or Doctor. Make a rats dream come true.</p>
